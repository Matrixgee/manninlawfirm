The bill was signed into law and is now HB766, which allows those with intractable epilepsy to use hemp extract, which is oil taken from marijuana without the psychoactive effects. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, NC made it legal for farmers to grow industrial hemp, which is similar to marijuana but does not have THC. Since then, hemp pharmacies have popped up around the Triangle area, serving individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, insomnia, anxiety and more. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In late 2018, Congress passed the 2018 Farm Bill making it legal to grow, sell, transport, and possess hemp across state lines so long as it is within the limits of the federal and state law. Hemp remains a highly regulated crop, with a limit 0.3 percent of THC and a license to grow among other restrictions, but the 2018 Farm Bill is good news for farmers and those in the hemp business. Hemp, and the CBD oil derived from hemp, will now be under the purview of the U.S. Department of Agriculture instead of the U.S. Justice Department&#8217;s Drug Enforcement Agency.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, there was a push to completely legalize marijuana for medical use. However, the bills failed to receive a committee vote and were not considered by North Carolina legislature.
