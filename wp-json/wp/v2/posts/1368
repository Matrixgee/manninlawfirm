And a new case management system being piloted in four North Carolina counties is making such visits even more of an ordeal by prolonging the time it takes to process such matters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Nobody wants to be in a criminal court,&#8221; said Raleigh-based attorney <a href=\"https:\/\/manninglaw.com\/criminal-attorneys-raleigh\/t-taylor-manning\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Taylor Manning<\/a>. &#8220;Especially the defendants who are there with their life and liberty on the line.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manning has been practicing criminal defense in Wake County for more than 10 years as a private attorney who also does contract work for the state as a court-appointed lawyer for indigent defendants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And a lot of people,&#8221; he added, &#8220;it&#8217;s very inconvenient to go to court, of course, and they want to get in and out quickly.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But things have slowed significantly since the introduction of a digital case management software system that went live Feb. 13 in Wake and three other pilot counties: Lee, Johnston and Harnett. And the new system is being rolled out at the same time courts continue to work through backlogs caused by the COVID pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The new program is replacing an antiquated system that &#8216;works well&#8217; but is &#8216;brittle&#8217;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The program,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nccourts.gov\/ecourts#odyssey-9369\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Odyssey<\/a>, is supposed to make it easier for the general public to access court files and submit payments. So far, however, it is causing major headaches for clerks, judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys like Manning and their clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.govtech.com\/computing\/tyler-technologies-signs-85-million-north-carolina-contract.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">contracted<\/a>&nbsp;with Texas-based Tyler Technologies to develop an integrated software system tailored to the needs of North Carolina courts. AOC&#8217;s Director, Andrew Heath, who came on board in 2021, said the state&#8217;s outdated filing system with its 1980s-era mainframe computer had to be replaced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I mean it works well but it&#8217;s brittle and it&#8217;s obsolete in many cases,&#8221; Heath told WUNC. &#8220;The mainframes are expensive, they&#8217;re very difficult to maintain, the security patches are difficult.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler won the 10-year, $85 million contract to develop the new system in 2019, after a competitive bidding process. Odyssey was supposed to go live this past October but&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nccourts.gov\/news\/tag\/general-news\/memorandum-ecourts-launch-delay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">got postponed<\/a>&nbsp;because of problems integrating it with programs run by law enforcement and other state agencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Courtroom flow is getting bogged down by computer-based bottlenecks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After Odyssey had been running in the pilot counties for a little more than a week, Manning described a plea agreement he had handled earlier that day in superior court. Manning had filled out a plea transcript, a checkbox form with the details of the agreement between the defendant and the prosecutor, scanned it into the electronic filing system and sent it to the judge&#8217;s queue. Then, the parties noticed a typo that had to be corrected on the form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And [the judge] can&#8217;t just delete that from his queue, he has to do something with it,&#8221; Manning explained. &#8220;So he ended up having to actually forward it back to the D.A.&#8217;s queue just to get it out of his box.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Manning, a time-consuming process ensued that included re-scanning the corrected transcript, sending it to the clerk&#8217;s computer queue, and then on to the judge&#8217;s queue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Where in the old days,&#8221; Manning said, &#8220;the judge might call the two attorneys up to the bench, we would agree on the change, maybe initial it, explain it to the defendant, and then proceed and that would all take about two minutes.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of the courtroom delays can be traced to the various computer queues, where clerks and judges must wait on one case file before they can move on to the next one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an email to WUNC, an AOC spokesman said his agency and Tyler Technologies are aware of the slowdowns and that ongoing work to resolve software defects\u2014and improved proficiency by court personnel\u2014will help improve the system&#8217;s performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Criminal law requires &#8216;a human touch,&#8217; attorney said<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wake County attorney Taylor Manning said he&#8217;s concerned about what could happen when a client misses a court date due to car trouble or illness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before Odyssey, Manning would find the assigned prosecutor, explain the situation, file a motion to strike the called and failed, get the judge&#8217;s signature on an order recalling the arrest, and personally deliver the order to the clerk&#8217;s office. Crisis averted in about 30 minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now Manning said he can&#8217;t physically track his motion as it slowly makes its way electronically from queue to queue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to tell my client because I don&#8217;t know how long it might be before the assistant D.A. looks at it, I don&#8217;t know how long it might be before the judge looks at it, I don&#8217;t know how long it&#8217;s going to be before that makes it back to the clerk,&#8221; Manning said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in the meantime, Manning added, there might be an officer looking to put his client in cuffs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are some things that require a human touch and I believe criminal law is one of those,&#8221; Manning said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the full article published in WUNC.org by Rusty Jacobs, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wunc.org\/news\/2023-03-05\/north-carolina-courts-electronic-case-management-system-sputtering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">click here<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For people charged with a crime, cited for a moving violation, or seeking a domestic violence protective order, a day in court is no picnic.
