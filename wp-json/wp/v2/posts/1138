However, the appropriate term to use depends on state law.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on to learn more about larceny to understand what it means to be charged with this crime and what consequences you may face if convicted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the Difference between Larceny and Theft?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, &#8220;theft&#8221; is an umbrella term that includes all different kinds of criminal stealing, including identity theft, theft of intellectual property, theft of services and theft of personal property. Meanwhile, \u201clarceny\u201d is considered one type of stealing under the general category of theft. The term is more narrowly defined as the theft of personal property capable of being possessed and carried away.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When speaking in legal terms, however, the definition and usage of \u201ctheft\u201d and \u201clarceny\u201d are determined by the state. The variations between these terms makes it especially important for you to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.manninglaw.com\/contact\/\">consult an experienced defense attorney<\/a> to understand how the crime is defined in the jurisdiction in which you are charged.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Does North Carolina Define Larceny and Theft?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Under North Carolina law, larceny is defined as the taking of another person\u2019s property without their consent and with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of that property&nbsp; (N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14.72.). The term \u201ctheft\u201d is not mentioned anywhere in our state\u2019s criminal statutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Larceny Statues in NC<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>North Carolina criminal statutes identify common larceny offense, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Receiving or possessing stolen goods (\u00a7 14-71, 14-71.1.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Concealment of merchandise in a store ( \u00a7 14-72.1.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shoplifting from a merchant ( \u00a7 14-72.3.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Larceny by employee (\u00a7 14-74.)&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Larceny of gasoline at a service station ( \u00a7 14-72.5.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Chop shop activity (\u00a7 14-72.7.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Felony larceny of motor vehicle parts ( \u00a7 14-72.8.).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the Classifications and Penalties for Larceny?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>North Carolina law does not make a distinction between \u201cpetty larceny\u201d or \u201cgrand larceny\u201d. Instead, this offense is charged as either a misdemeanor or felony depending on the value of the property taken and the type of item. Below are the type of larceny charges you could face.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Misdemeanor Larceny<\/strong> &#8211; In most cases, theft of property that is worth $1,000 or less is a Class 1 misdemeanor. Concealing merchandise in a store for purposes of shoplifting may be a Class 2 or 3 depending on the number of convictions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Felony Larceny<\/strong> &#8211; Theft of property worth more than $1,000 is a Class H felony; or the theft must meet other specific requirements, such as robbery of a person, burglary, the theft of an explosive or firearm, or a record in the custody of North Carolina State Archives. The following offenses are also classified as felonies:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Receiving or possessing stolen goods valued over $1,000 if the accused knew or had reason to know that the goods were stolen (Class H)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Larceny by employees if the property involved is valued at $100 or more (Class C felony) or less than $100 (Class H felony)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Larceny from a construction site or motor vehicle parts (Class I felony)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Chop shop activity (Class G felony)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Penalties &#8211; <\/strong>North Carolina looks at a defendant\u2019s prior criminal history and the facts of the case when determining the appropriate punishment or the \u201cpresumptive range\u201d of a jail sentence, which could range between 4 to 25 months.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Talk to a Defense Attorney about Your Larceny Case<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The punishment for larceny in North Carolina has an extremely wide range of jail time depending on your criminal record or the circumstances.
