By definition, a felony is a crime that\u2019s based on previous judicial outcomes and punishable by imprisonment at a state level. However, there are nuances to this definition. Let\u2019s break down how they\u2019re categorized and what a felony means in North Carolina specifically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The NC Felony Sentencing Chart<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>North Carolina uses a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nccourts.gov\/assets\/documents\/publications\/FelonyChart_1013MaxChart.pdf?JOZLdcExFM1TmlzHLiPcH7dUcMjQ8Ls7\">grid-like sentencing chart<\/a> to determine felony sentencing. This includes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. The Class of Felony<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In North Carolina, there are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nccourts.gov\/assets\/documents\/publications\/Sample-list-2017.pdf\">ten main categories of felonies<\/a>. They\u2019re categorized alphabetically, in descending order of severeness and make up the y-axis of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nccourts.gov\/assets\/documents\/publications\/FelonyChart_1013MaxChart.pdf?JOZLdcExFM1TmlzHLiPcH7dUcMjQ8Ls7\">sentencing chart<\/a>. There are general punishment timeframes for each category, but these can become even longer or shorter based on the next two factors we\u2019ll cover.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Categories include:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Class A<\/strong> (death or life without parole) to <strong>Class D<\/strong> felonies (38-160 months):<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These classes include the most heinous violent and sexual crimes but can cover unlawful use of weapons of mass destruction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Class E<\/strong> (15-63 months), <strong>Class F<\/strong> (10-41 months) and <strong>Class G<\/strong> felonies (8-31 months):<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This encompasses a wide range of potential sentences, with some of the associated crimes having mandatory minimum sentences. They include everything from child abuse to assault with a deadly weapon.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Class H<\/strong> felonies (4-25 months) and <strong>Class I<\/strong> felonies (3-12 months):<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Class H includes everything from first-degree forgery to possessing stolen goods. Class I felonies range from breaking or entering a car to check forgery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. The Person\u2019s Prior Convictions\/Criminal Record<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Each prior conviction on someone&#8217;s criminal record will have an associated point value. Adding these together determines the <strong>prior record level<\/strong>, ranging from I to VI, which is displayed on the x-axis of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nccourts.gov\/assets\/documents\/publications\/FelonyChart_1013MaxChart.pdf?JOZLdcExFM1TmlzHLiPcH7dUcMjQ8Ls7\">sentencing chart<\/a>. The general range of a sentence is determined by where this number and the class of the felony intersect. Class A felonies are the only category that do not account for this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. The Disposition Range<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The disposition range consists of three categories and also contributes to the length of a sentence. It\u2019s broken down on the top-right of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nccourts.gov\/assets\/documents\/publications\/FelonyChart_1013MaxChart.pdf?JOZLdcExFM1TmlzHLiPcH7dUcMjQ8Ls7\">sentencing chart<\/a>:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The <strong>presumptive range<\/strong> includes crimes being considered for a standard length of sentencing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>aggravated range<\/strong> encompasses crimes that are considered notably evil, such as crimes committed against children.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>mitigated range<\/strong> is usually applied to crimes that are deemed \u201cunintentional\u201d and can warrant a shorter sentence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Happens to First-Time Felony Offenders in NC?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s contingent on the severity of the offense. Most low-level, first-time offenders can go through a diversion program, like North Carolina&#8217;s First Offenders Program. These programs offer an alternative to jail time by providing the option of schooling, work, rehab\/drug testing and more. Generally, they&#8217;re education or rehabilitation centric. Successfully completing a diversion program can eliminate jail time and remove the offense from a criminal record.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Manning Law Knows Felonies<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Manning Law attorneys are experts with the ins-and-outs of felonies in North Carolina.
