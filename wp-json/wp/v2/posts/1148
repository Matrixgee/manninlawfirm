In North Carolina, DWI is the official legal term to describe driving while impaired. Many people think that a DWI means that you are under the influence of illegal substances or alcohol. However, any impairments, including driving while on certain prescription drugs, can qualify for a DWI. Read this blog to learn more about DWI laws in North Carolina.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-considered-a-dwi-in-north-carolina\">What is Considered A DWI in North Carolina?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>North Carolina considers any driver who has a blood alcohol content (BAC) of at least 0.08 to be driving while impaired. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.notredamecollege.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/-Blood-Alcohol-Chart.pdf\">BAC<\/a> depends on your weight and your sex assigned at birth. For example, if a 200-pound man has three drinks in one hour, his BAC is 0.08. Also, liquor has a higher ABV than beer, so what you drink impacts how quickly you reach 0.08.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Driving under the influence of any illegal substance automatically counts as a DWI in North Carolina. Also, driving while impaired because of prescription drugs, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/dui.drivinglaws.org\/ncarolina.php\">opiates<\/a>, can qualify for a DWI even if&nbsp; you use them with an active prescription. The court uses all the circumstances of the driving and behavior of a person charged with DWI to determine impairment, not just what they find in the blood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results from a chemical analysis can indeed serve as valid evidence in impaired driving cases. This type of analysis is recognized as sufficient proof for determining a person&#8217;s level of alcohol concentration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s how it typically works:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>If Tested<\/strong>: Individuals who undergo a chemical analysis of their blood sample can use the results to argue against allegations.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Threshold Levels<\/strong>: For it to benefit the defense, the results must show that the alcohol concentration was below the legal limit, which is generally 0.08 or higher, at a relevant time after driving.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In essence, chemical analysis results are crucial pieces of evidence and can play an integral role in both the prosecution and the defense in impaired driving cases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Needs to Be Included in an Impaired Driving Prosecution Pleading?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For a pleading in an impaired driving case to be considered complete and effective, it must encompass specific details that adequately frame the alleged offense. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the essential elements:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Time and Place<\/strong>: Clearly specify when and where the offense took place. This establishes the context and helps tie the incident to a specific event.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Driving Activity<\/strong>: Include an allegation that the defendant was operating a vehicle. This is a crucial aspect that connects the individual to the action of driving.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: Mention that the driving occurred either on a highway or in a public vehicular area. This detail establishes jurisdiction and legality, crucial for prosecution.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Impairment Accusation<\/strong>: Assert that the driver was under the influence of an impairing substance during the incident. This allegation is at the heart of impaired driving charges and must be clearly stated.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, the pleading should paint a clear picture involving who, what, when, how, and where regarding the alleged impaired driving incident. Such thorough documentation ensures it&#8217;s legally sufficient and aligned with prosecution standards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-are-the-north-carolina-dwi-levels\">What Are the North Carolina DWI Levels?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>North Carolina classifies DWIs based on aggravating factors that impact the severity of the DWI charge:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-gross-aggravating-factors\">Gross Aggravating Factors<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gross aggravating factors are the most severe factor that impacts your DWI sentence. Examples of qualifying situations include seriously injuring another person when driving while impaired, other convictions for DWI, having children in the vehicle, and other factors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-aggravating-factors\">Aggravating Factors<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although aggravating factors are considered less severe than gross aggravating factors, their consequences are still detrimental. For example, reckless driving when driving while impaired qualifies as an aggravating factor.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-mitigating-factors\">Mitigating Factors<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mitigating factors are reasons that might justify why you are driving while impaired. One example is that you have taken steps to correct your behavior such as having a substance abuse assessment and following treatment recommendations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judges look at all of the present factors and combine them to determine your sentence.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dwi-levels\">DWI Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The state of North Carolina has five DWI levels that vary in jail time and fines. For detailed information about them, visit the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncdps.gov\/our-organization\/law-enforcement\/state-highway-patrol\/faq\/driving-while-impaired\">North Carolina Department of Public Safety<\/a>\u2019s website or call one of the lawyers at Manning Law Firm<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-much-does-a-dwi-cost-in-nc-nbsp\">How Much Does A DWI Cost in NC?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The fines for a DWI can range from $200 &#8211; $4,000 depending on the severity of the DWI and your driving record. Also, if you need to go to court, then you also must pay additional court fees.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-a-dwi-a-felony-in-nc-nbsp\">Is A DWI a Felony in NC?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DWIs are considered a misdemeanor in North Carolina. However, if you have multiple DWIs on your record or the circumstances of your DWI are especially bad, the court can charge it as a felony.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When can someone question the admissibility of chemical analysis results?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A person may challenge these results if they believe there&#8217;s a valid reason under specific legal provisions, including potential issues with the testing procedures or equipment used. This also covers situations where the legal guidelines concerning chemical analysis weren&#8217;t fully followed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In such cases, individuals can argue that the test results shouldn&#8217;t be considered valid evidence in their case. It&#8217;s crucial that any challenge is rooted in the applicable legal standards and requirements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-long-does-a-dwi-stay-on-record-in-nc-nbsp\">How Long Does A DWI Stay On Record in NC?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A conviction of DWI stays on your record forever, which could prevent you from achieving some of your goals. So, if you plan to drink, find a designated driver or take public transit. Also, if you need to take medicine that might impact your ability to drive, then try to have a friend or family member drive you to your destination. Before you get behind the wheel after drinking, be sure to check your BAC to know whether or not you are safe to drive.&nbsp;<br>Need help with a potential DWI charge in North Carolina?
