The investigations involve subpoenas for records, grand jury subpoenas, inspection of financial records, review of tax records and interviews by federal and state investigators of practically every aspect of the person being investigated: financial holdings, assets, businesses, tax returns, bank records, telephone records, emails and other manner and means of communications.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>White Collar Crime Consequences<\/h2>\n<p><span>In federal prosecutions, the amount of the fraud proven as well as the manner and means of accomplishing the fraud drive the potential sentencing factors. In State sentencing, particularly in North Carolina, the possible jail sentences can be dramatically increased by overall, or cumulative amount of the fraud. In North Carolina, if the cumulative amount of a fraudulent scheme exceeds $100,000, then the jail sentences available to the court increase tremendously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Depending on the extent and effect of the scheme or fraud alleged, the following could result:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incarceration<\/li>\n<li>Asset seizure<\/li>\n<li>Significant fines<\/li>\n<li>Restitution assessments<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Why Hire Manning Law Firm To Protect You?<\/h2>\n<p><span>With prior federal prosecutorial experience and years of representing companies and individuals in financial investigations, our attorneys offer a combination of experience, acumen and perspective.
