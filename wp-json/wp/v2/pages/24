Even if you were planning to pay, simply getting caught with hidden, unpaid for items can mean a conviction.<\/p>\n<h3>Misdemeanor Larceny<\/h3>\n<p>Larceny of property or receiving or possessing stolen goods, where the value of the property or goods is not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), is a Class 1 misdemeanor.<\/p>\n<p>Shoplifting and misdemeanor larceny conviction can scar your record and current possibly future employers may be wary to hire you as an employee. Manning Law Firm can help you avoid a conviction and other consequences.<\/p>\n<h3>Felony Larceny<\/h3>\n<p>Larceny of goods or receiving or possession of stolen goods with value exceeding thousand dollars ($1,000) is a Class H felony. What many people are unaware of is that the value of the goods stolen or possessed does not have to exceed $1000 and is still a Class H felony, if taken from a person, a construction site, a business or store by disabling or thwarting a security device, or in large number of other situations. You need a skilled theft lawyer to ensure you have been correctly charged and have a choice of all available defenses.<\/p>\n<h3>Obtaining Property by False Pretense<\/h3>\n<p>Obtaining property by false pretense is most often charged when a person trades stolen goods with a pawn shop or returns stolen items to a store for a \u201crefund\u201d. Manning Law Firm has the experience and the knowledge you need to resolve your case fairly.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s crucial to your case to get started as soon as possible.
