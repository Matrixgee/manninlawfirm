While many other states are slowly decriminalizing the possession of certain drugs, North Carolina is not moving in that direction and punishments can be surprisingly harsh.<\/p>\n<h3>Drug Possession with Intent to Sell and Deliver (PWISD)<\/h3>\n<p>In North Carolina, drug Possession with Intent to Sell and Deliver (PWISD) is a felony. Though often recognized as a charge associated with the amount of drugs in your possession, you can be charged with PWISD for possessing any amount of illegal substances. &nbsp;Manning Law Firm is there to defend you when it feels like nobody is on your side.<\/p>\n<h3>Drug Trafficking<\/h3>\n<p>If you have been accused of drug trafficking, it is imperative to hire a lawyer immediately. Drug Trafficking in North Carolina is punishable by significant mandatory minimum prison time, but with the right lawyer on your side, it may be possible to reduce your exposure. Manning Law Firm will work to help you make deals with the justice system that may minimize your punishment.<\/p>\n<h3>Drug Conspiracy<\/h3>\n<p>Whether you stood guard while drug activities occurred, or were in the wrong place at the wrong time, you can be charged with drug conspiracy. In this case, it\u2019s crucial to have a lawyer who understands the justice system on your side.<\/p>\n<h3>Raleigh Drug Lawyers<\/h3>\n<p>Manning Law Firm can offer you the assistance you need to fight your drug charges.
