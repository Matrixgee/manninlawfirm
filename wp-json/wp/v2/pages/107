Through investigation and analysis of the facts and the situation, then through discussions and negotiation with prosecutors, a different result can be reached, with a better outcome for the client.<\/p>\n<p>The lawyers at Manning Law Firm have been successful in obtaining dismissals of serious sex offense cases against children through trial, or through investigation which revealed that the person we represented should not have been charged, or that the quality of the evidence is such that the prosecution cannot win the case.<\/p>\n<p>In many cases where children are the alleged victims, we bring in forensic experts in child psychology, investigation experts, and others to challenge the quality and sufficiency of the evidence the prosecutors are relying on. In many&nbsp;cases we have obtained Not Guilty verdicts or dismissals for clients who were initially accused of very serious crimes against children. Our child abuse lawyers have the experience and the know-how to investigate and the trial know-how and experience to present determined, thorough and knowledgeable defense trial efforts.<\/p>\n<h3>Why Choose Manning as Your Child Abuse Case Lawyer?<\/h3>\n<p>At Manning Law Firm,<meta charset=\"utf-8\">At Manning Law Firm, our lawyers have handled cases and represented persons charged with crimes against children for many years.
