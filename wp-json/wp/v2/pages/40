An EPO lasts between three to seven days and gives the victim time to request a longer-term protection order.<\/span><\/p>\n<h5>What does it mean to have a domestic violence protective order against you?<\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Domestic Violence Protective Order (\u201cDVPO\u201d or \u201c50B order\u201d or \u201cdomestic violence restraining order\u201d) is a longer-term court order that prohibits the defendant from committing further abuse. There are two types: an ex parte temporary protective order (lasts until a full court hearing takes place) and a final domestic protective order (lasts up to 1 year). During such time, a perpetrator can be arrested for violating the order.<\/span><\/p>\n<h5>What happens if you violate a protective order?<\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EPOs and DVPOs are ordered in civil court. They won\u2019t count as criminal convictions and do not appear on the defendant\u2019s criminal record. However, a defendant can be arrested and criminally charged for violating a DVPO.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Criminal Domestic Violence Laws<\/h3>\n<h5>What would a criminal conviction mean?<\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">North Carolina does not have specific domestic violence charges. Instead, you\u2019ll face a general misdemeanor or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.schlosserandpritchettlaw.com\/greensboro-felony-lawyers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">felony<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> charge for your crime. However, if a judge determines that you are or were formerly in a personal relationship with the victim, you can receive additional criminal sentencing and show a domestic violence crime on your criminal record.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What should you do if you&#8217;ve been charged with domestic violence?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have been charged, it is crucial that you contact an experienced Domestic Violence attorney immediately.
