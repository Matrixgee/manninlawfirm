In the real world, the use of the word \u201csubject\u201d means that you are either (a) being investigated as a potential target or defendant in a federal investigation; or (b) you are a person of interest as a potential witness from whom the Government wants information either about you or about the subject matter which it thinks you have knowledge. This could result in your being charged or the prosecutor may believe you have information, which may further its investigation.<\/p>\n<h2>What is a target letter?<\/h2>\n<p>A \u201ctarget letter\u201d has different meaning. A target letter usually comes to you at a time where the United States Attorney has selected you for prosecution, and is notifying you that it has made the decision to charge you, but is giving you a short amount of time to obtain counsel and meet with the prosecution to either (a) convince the prosecutors why they have the wrong idea about you, or (b) to negotiate with the prosecution in relation to possible cooperation in exchange for a lesser charge or a more favorable sentencing opportunity.<\/p>\n<h2>What do I do if I receive a subject letter or target letter from the United States Attorney?<\/h2>\n<p>In either a subject letter situation or a target letter situation, it is crucial that you retain counsel who offers experience in federal investigations, negotiation and trials, to advise, counsel and assist you in dealing with the prosecutors.
